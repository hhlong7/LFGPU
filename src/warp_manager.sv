/* Warp Builder
* The goal of this block to the split up the jobs of the warp schedular into more digestable jobs
* this job is to take the thread that are sent the the SM and the put them into groups called warps.
* A warp is a group of threads of a static size difined by the archtecter that are to be run in parallel on a core.
* In industy the warp size is a static 32 threads in the case of GAR the user will be able to set the size of warps.
* The Module will also be responcable for reodering warps if that is required
* Inputs 
* (Threads, Next_PCs, Thread_count)
* Outputs
* (Warps_id, Num_Warps)
